    "# The Poisson Distribution\n",
    "The poisson distribution has a special relation to the binomial distribution. The theoretical underpinnings are as follows. Imagine that we take a time period and break it into subintervals that are so small that at most one successful event could occur. We can then imagine that for any of these subintervals, a binomial distribution could apply where there is some probability of the event occuring p, a probability q=1-p that the event does not occur, and a probability of 0 that more then one event occurs. We assume that as we cut time into smaller and smaller intervals, the chance of a success should go down. If we take the limit of the binomial distribution as n goes to infinity (more and more subintervals that are progressively smaller), the result is the poisson distribution.\n",

This is then exactly how the poisson is used in practice, if I know the average number of occurences in a given interval, what is the probability that the actual number of occurences is slightly more, slightly less, far more or far less?"
